# NodeJs-Kahoot-Bot
This is a bot system for Kahoot that actually works. To use it you can install the files that run the command (npm i) in the directory. Then you can run the system by running the command(node app.js) in the same directory and open localhost:3000 in your web browser. After you are on the webpage you can chose the game pin and the amount of bots. Have fun!!!!!
